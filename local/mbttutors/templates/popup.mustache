        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's <br/>standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a <br/>type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining <br/>essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum <br/>passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
